Pixel Art Project
This is a simple web-based pixel art project that allows you to create pixel art by coloring individual grid cells. You can customize the grid size, choose colors, and even toggle an eraser mode. Here's a brief overview of the project:

Project Components
HTML File (index.html): This file defines the structure of the web page. It includes a grid container for drawing pixel art, color input, grid size input, and buttons for erasing and resetting the grid.

CSS File (style.css): This file contains the styling for the web page, defining the appearance of the grid, buttons, and other elements.

JavaScript File (main.js): The JavaScript file contains the functionality for drawing, erasing, and resizing the grid. It also handles user interactions and events.

Usage
Clone the project, and ppen the index.html file in a web browser.
Use the color input to select a color.
Use the grid size input to change the size of the grid (the grid is initially set to 25x25 cells).
Click and drag on the grid cells to color them with the selected color.
Click the eraser button to toggle the eraser mode.
Click the reset button to clear the grid and start over.

Feel free to create your own pixel art using this simple web application!

Note: The project uses Font Awesome icons and a custom font from a CDN, so make sure you have an internet connection when using it.
